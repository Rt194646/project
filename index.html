      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <h2>Key Evidence Timeline</h2>

      <h3>1995</h3>
      <p><em>Doom</em> used 2.5D pixel graphics that were innovative at the time. But games were still seen as simple and childish.</p>

      <h3>2000</h3>
      <p><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> showed how far 3D design had come—smooth environments, AI enemies, and immersive worlds helped games grow in seriousness.</p>

      <h3>2010</h3>
      <p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em> used HD graphics, motion capture, and complex open-world design. It made players feel like they were in a movie—changing how society viewed games forever.</p>

      <h2>Public Perception Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1995:</strong> “Games are just for fun or for kids.”</li>
