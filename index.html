      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Between 1995 and 2010, video game graphics improved significantly due to rapid advances in computer technology,
        graphics hardware, and design techniques. This evolution didn’t just affect how games looked — it influenced how
        society viewed video games themselves. At the beginning of this period, games were mostly seen as entertainment
        for kids and teenagers. By 2010, they had evolved into cinematic, immersive experiences that were often compared
        to film and even considered a form of art. In this project, we’ll examine how improvements in graphics technology
        helped video games gain cultural legitimacy and changed how people talked about and understood them.

      <h2>Claim</h2>
      <p>
        Between 1995 and 2010, improvements in video game graphics played a key role in shifting public perception of games
        — from childish distractions to serious cultural works. This shift was driven by better technology, storytelling,
        and increasing media attention.

      <h2>1995: Simple 3D and Pixel Art</h2>

      <p>
        In 1995, most video games were still using 2D or early 3D graphics. One of the most iconic games of that time was
        <em>Doom</em>, a first-person shooter known for its fast gameplay and gory combat. The graphics were considered
        advanced back then, using a pseudo-3D engine and pixelated sprites. However, to modern eyes, the visuals look flat,
        repetitive, and blocky. Still, Doom helped shape the first-person shooter genre and introduced millions of players
        to the idea of immersive, digital environments. Despite its success, games like Doom were not seen as "serious" media.
        They were often blamed for promoting violence, especially among teenagers, and rarely received positive attention
        from the mainstream press. This reflected a common belief at the time that video games were mostly meant for kids
        and lacked any deep artistic or cultural value. The simple visuals reinforced this view: they were fun and engaging,
        but not respected.

      <h2>2000: Realistic Environments and 3D Worlds</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/Halo_-_Combat_Evolved_(XBox_version_-_box_art).jpg" alt="Halo 2001 cover art" />
      <p>
        By the year 2000, 3D graphics had become standard, and game worlds were becoming larger, more detailed, and more immersive.
        <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, released in 2001, is a perfect example. The game used advanced lighting, texture mapping,
        and polygon-based models to create futuristic environments that felt alive and believable. In addition to technical
        advances, game stories also improved. Halo combined military science fiction with dramatic music and character development,
        helping players feel emotionally connected to the experience. By this time, games had become a major part of popular
        culture. They were no longer just for kids — adults played them too. Media coverage improved slightly, though concerns
        about video game violence and addiction were still common in public discussions. What made Halo especially influential
        was how it combined technical achievement with cultural significance. It became a reference point for what games could
        do both visually and narratively.

      <h2>2010: Cinematic and Emotional Storytelling</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Red_Dead_Redemption.jpg" alt="Red Dead Redemption 2010" />
      <p>
        By 2010, games like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>Mass Effect 2</em> featured near-photorealistic graphics,
        complex facial animations, and expansive open worlds. Red Dead Redemption in particular used advanced lighting,
        motion capture, and detailed textures to create a Western world that felt authentic and emotionally powerful.
        Players could ride horses across vast deserts, watch sunsets, or explore lively towns full of NPCs (non-player characters).
        Games like these received critical acclaim not just from gaming media, but also from mainstream publications like
        <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em>. By this point, many people began to refer to games as “art.”
        The perception of games had changed — they were now capable of delivering emotional and narrative depth similar to film or books.
        This level of quality would not have been possible without the massive graphical improvements that took place over the years.
        Motion capture allowed for realistic human movement, while high-definition textures made environments feel real. The line
        between reality and virtual worlds was starting to blur, and society began taking games more seriously because of it.

      <h2>Public Perception Over Time</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1995:</strong> Games are fun but childish. Mostly for kids or teens.</li>
        <li><strong>2000:</strong> Games are cool and increasingly mainstream, but still controversial.</li>
        <li><strong>2010:</strong> Games are complex, artistic, and culturally important.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The graphics revolution helped legitimize video games in the eyes of the public. Better visuals allowed for more
        emotional storytelling, more believable characters, and more immersive worlds. With those elements in place,
        games earned a new level of respect. The transformation wasn’t only about pixels — it was about perception. As
        graphics improved, so did the credibility of video games. As technology advanced, so did society's willingness to
        see games as more than just a way to pass time.
